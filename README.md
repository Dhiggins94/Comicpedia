## Wireframes
Here is my wireframe. I built it first with a phone in mind.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- use postman to get data from the api as proof it works
- Build website using html, css, javascript
- make an heaader,footer, and about us
- make the about us page show an alert on the screen to giving information about the site.
- have 3 functional buttons render data from the api
- have each button that reperesents hero, villians and netural bring random characters from each alignment
- show a image, and information about each character when one of the button is selected

#### PostMVP  

- use another api that allow me to bring videos of those characters that was seletced with them

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

|  Day | Deliverable | Status
|---|---| ---|
|June 21| Prompt / Wireframes / Priority Matrix / Timeframes | Complete
|June 22| Project Approval / Core Application Structure (HTML, CSS, etc.) | Incomplete
|June 23| Pseudocode / actual code | Incomplete
|June 24| Initial Clickable Model  | Incomplete
|June 25| MVP | Incomplete
|June 28| Presentations | Incomplete

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matrix.  Link this image in a similar manner to your wireframes

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Getting the API working | M | 3 hrs| 3 hrs | 0 hrs |
| Setting up the html and css | H | 5hrs| 0 hrs | 0 hrs |
| get functionality on the about me | H | 2 hrs| 0 hrs | 0 hrs |
| Get functionality on the buttons | H | 8hrs| 0 hrs | 0 hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
