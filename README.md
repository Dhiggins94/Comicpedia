![WireFrame for website](https://i.imgur.com/nRaLZOD.png " its wireframe of the website built for phone")




#### MVP 

- use postman to get data from the api as proof it works
- Build website using html, css, javascript
- make an about us show an alert to tell the user about the site
- style website with flexbox and use @media query 
- have  functional buttons render data from the api
- have each button that reperesents heroes and villians bring random characters from each alignment if possible
- show a image, and information about each character when one of the button is selected

#### PostMVP  

- use another api that allow me to bring videos of those characters that was seletced with them
- add another button for netural alignment
